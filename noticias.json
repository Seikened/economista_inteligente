                "summary": "(Reuters) -Tesla teased an October 7 event, in which investors and analysts anticipate a more affordable model to sustain sales momentum, sending the shares of the Elon Musk-led electric automaker 4% higher on Monday.  In a nine-second video posted on social media platform X on Sunday, Tesla showed a vehicle with its headlights illuminated in a dark setting, while hinting at an event set for Tuesday in a separate video that had \"10/7\" at the end.  The teaser follows Tesla's record third-quarter deliveries, driven by a surge in EV purchases ahead of the expiration of the $7,500 U.S. EV tax credit on September 30.",
