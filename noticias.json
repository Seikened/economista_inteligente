The decision at least partially settles a question of whether and how Qualcomm would continue to work with Arm technology, following an acrimonious legal battle between the two last year, and the move is likely to raise revenue for Arm which charges more for the newer tech.  San Diego, California-based Qualcomm last week introduced a new generation of PC and phone chips.",
