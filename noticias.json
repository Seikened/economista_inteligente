The funding, led by Telo co-founder and designer Yves B\u00e9har and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, shows investors are still willing to back entrants despite a string of bankruptcies that followed the post-pandemic EV listing boom.  Other investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, E12 Ventures and Nova Threshold, Telo said on Tuesday.",
