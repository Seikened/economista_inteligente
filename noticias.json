The Chamber polled its members over whether they would be willing to join a lawsuit against the H-1B visa policy change after Trump disclosed the fee in September.",

                "summary": "STORY: Samsung is expected to post its highest third-quarter profit since 2022.Analysts polled by LSEG say the surge is driven by higher memory chip prices, backed by AI-driven server demand.They project the South Korean tech giant will rake in over $7 billion for the July to September period, up 10% from a year earlier.This comes ahead of Samsung's official estimates out Tuesday, with full results due later this month.The expected recovery offsets weaker sales volumes for high-bandwidth memory, or HBM chips.Samsung's profits and share price had taken a hit, in part due to delays supplying the latest models of those chips to Nvidia.But industry experts say market sentiment toward the firm is improving after deals with OpenAI and Tesla.Since the EV pioneer agreed to source semiconductors from Samsung, in a $16.5 billion deal signed in July, the chipmaker's shares have risen more than 43%.While local rival SK Hynix has gained more from the AI-driven demand, Samsung has been held back by its exposure to China, where advanced chip sales are restricted by the U.S.Gauging the firm's prospects, experts say they're also wary of the effects of U.S. tariffs on semiconductors, and China's tightening controls on the rare earth minerals\u00a0used in tech products.",
